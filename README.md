RustDesk ID Changer

RustDesk Github: https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk

With the powershell script file here, the ID information of the RustDesk remote connection program will automatically turn into the name of the host computer.

There is no need to reboot.

RustDesk ID information sometimes does not change after image deployment in computer laboratory environments, the problem will be solved with this script file.

Tested on Windows 7 - 8.1 - 10 and 11.

It is run as administrator with the following command:

PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File RustDeskID.ps1
